## Guess The Number
This is a simple game that the player guesses a 3-digit decimal number. Each digit has a unique number so there is no repeating of the same number among the 3 digits. Each time the player makes a guess, there is a display showing the totol attempts, and for each attempt, how many digits are correct, and if they are in the correct column. The player has succeeded when all the 3 digits have the correct values.
